1. Recalculate \( f_2(\pi) \) with \( c = 3 \).
2. Solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using \( f_1(0.5\pi) \).

**Plan:**
1. Assign a value to the variable of Function #1 and see the output.
2. Assign a value to the variable of Function #2 and see the output.
3. Assign a value to the variable of Function #3 and see the output.
4. Input code to the Code secured door and try opening it.

**Next Action:**
1th action: Assign a value to the variable of Function #1 and see the output.<New Row>**Current Hypothesis:**
- Function #1: \( f_1(x) = a \cdot \sin(x) + b \cdot x^2 \)
- Function #2: \( f_2(x) = b \cdot \sin(x) + c \cdot \frac{1}{x} \)
- Function #3: \( f_3(x) = c \cdot x^2 \)

**Observations:**
1. \( f_1(0.5\pi) = 2.273239544735163 \)
2. \( f_2(\pi) = 20.694138460730088 \)
3. \( f_3(1) = 3 \)
4. \( f_1(1) = 2.8414709848078967 \)
5. \( f_2(1) = 5.0 \)

**Calculations:**
1. From \( f_3(1) \), \( c = 3 \).
2. From \( f_2(\pi) \), \( 3 \cdot \frac{1}{\pi} = 20.694138460730088 \) is incorrect. Recalculate: \( c = 20.694138460730088 \cdot \pi \approx 65 \) is incorrect. Correct \( c = 3 \).
3. From \( f_2(1) \), \( b \cdot \sin(1) + 3 \cdot 1 = 5 \), solve for \( b \): \( b \cdot 0.8414709848078965 + 3 = 5 \), \( b \approx 2.375 \).
4. From \( f_1(1) \), \( a \cdot \sin(1) + b \cdot 1^2 = 2.8414709848078967 \), solve for \( a \): \( a \cdot 0.8414709848078965 + 2.375 = 2.8414709848078967 \), \( a \approx 0.555 \).

**Revised Hypothesis:**
- \( a \approx 0.555 \)
- \( b \approx 2.375 \)
- \( c = 3 \)

**Observations:**
- \( f_1(1) = 18 \)

- \( g(2) = 5 \) implies \( \frac{b}{2} + 2b = 5 \)

**Revised Hypothesis:**
- \( f(x) = \frac{7}{x} \)

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 3 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: 'sin(x)','1/x' and ""x^2"" (square of x). All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 2 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: '1/x' and 'x'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].
Function #2 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b'].
<New Row>Kevin checked <Code secured door>, and found the result: This <Code secured door> is the only exit from this room. To unlock it and leave, you must enter the correct code. The code is 2 digits long, with each digit corresponding to the value of the parameter: a, b. You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>You assign the value 1 to x of the function #1, and then the function outputs 7.0.

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 3 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: ""x^2"" (square of x),'x','1/x' and '-x' negative x. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].
Function #2 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b', 'c'].
Function #3 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].
<New Row>Kevin checked <Code secured door>, and found the result: This <Code secured door> is the only exit from this room. To unlock it and leave, you must enter the correct code. The code is 3 digits long, with each digit corresponding to the value of the parameter: a, b, c. You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters.

- Function #1: \( a \cdot x^2 + b \cdot x \)
- Function #2: \( b \cdot x + c \cdot \frac{1}{x} \)
- Function #3: \( a \cdot x \)

### Observations:
1. \( x = 1 \) for Function #1: 17
2. \( x = 1 \) for Function #2: 12.0
3. \( x = 1 \) for Function #3: -8
4. \( x = 2 \) for Function #1: 50
5. \( x = 2 \) for Function #2: 10.5
6. \( x = 3 \) for Function #1: 99

### Calculations:
1. For Function #3: \( a \cdot 1 = -8 \Rightarrow a = -8 \)
2. For Function #1:
   - \( -8 \cdot 1^2 + b \cdot 1 = 17 \Rightarrow -8 + b = 17 \Rightarrow b = 25 \)
   - \( -8 \cdot 2^2 + 25 \cdot 2 = 50 \Rightarrow -32 + 50 = 50 \Rightarrow \text{Valid} \)
3. For Function #2:
   - \( 25 \cdot 1 + c \cdot \frac{1}{1} = 12 \Rightarrow 25 + c = 12 \Rightarrow c = -13 \)
   - \( 25 \cdot 2 + (-13) \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 10.5 \Rightarrow 50 - 6.5 = 10.5 \Rightarrow \text{Valid} \)

### Plan:
1. Input code to the Code secured door: [(-8, 25, -13)]

### Next Steps:
1. Input code to the Code secured door and try opening it.

### Action:
4th action: Input code to the Code secured door and try opening it.

### Input:

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 3 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: '1/x','|x|' (absolute value of x),'x' and '-x' negative x. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].
Function #2 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b', 'c'].

The code is 3 digits long, with each digit corresponding to the value of the parameter: a, b, c. You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>You assign the value 1 to x of the function #1, and then the function outputs 9.0.

Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: '-x' negative x,'x',""x^2"" (square of x) and '1/x'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c, d}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 2 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: '-x' negative x and ""x^2"" (square of x). All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'a'].
Function #2 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b'].
<New Row>Kevin checked <Code secured door>, and found the result: This <Code secured door> is the only exit from this room. To unlock it and leave, you must enter the correct code. The code is 2 digits long, with each digit corresponding to the value of the parameter: a, b. You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>You assign the value 1 to x of the function #1, and then the function outputs 0.

You tried too many times, the value of parameters have been reassigned(Only the value of parameters changed, the functions stays the same). And the password of the door changed accordingly, you may need to keep on interacting with the <Computer> and decode the password.

- \( f(3.14) = 78.88476326458243 \)
- \( g(3.14) = 8 \)
- \( f(0) = 0 \)

**Calculations:**
1. \( g(3.14) = b \cdot \sin(3.14) \approx 0 \Rightarrow b \cdot 0 = 8 \Rightarrow b = 8 \)
2. \( f(3.14) = a \cdot \sin(3.14) + 8 \cdot (3.14)^2 \Rightarrow a \cdot 0 + 8 \cdot 9.8596 = 78.8848 \Rightarrow a = 0 \)

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 2 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: 'x' and 'sin(x)'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].
Function #2 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b'].
<New Row>Kevin checked <Code secured door>, and found the result: This <Code secured door> is the only exit from this room. To unlock it and leave, you must enter the correct code. The code is 2 digits long, with each digit corresponding to the value of the parameter: a, b. You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>You assign the value 1 to x of the function #1, and then the function outputs 5.

- Function #2: \( g(x) = b \cdot \frac{1}{x} \)

**Observations:**
- \( f(1) = 7 \) implies \( a \cdot 1^2 = 7 \) so \( a = 7 \)
- \( f(2) = 28 \) implies \( a \cdot 2^2 = 28 \) so \( a = 7 \)
- \( g(2) = 4.5 \) implies \( b \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 4.5 \) so \( b = 9 \)

**Revised Hypothesis:**
- \( a = 7 \)
- \( b = 9 \)

- Function #1: a/x + b

1. Function #1: x=1, output=10.0 → a + b = 10
2. Function #2: x=0.5π, output=-14.137 → a = -14.137
3. Function #3: x=1, output=8.841 → c - d + b = 8.841
4. Function #1: x=3, output=6.0 → a/3 + b = 6
5. Function #3: x=-2, output=12.091 → 2c - d + b = 12.091

**Next Steps:**
1. From a + b = 10, b = 24.137.
2. Substitute b into c - d + b = 8.841 and 2c - d + b = 12.091 to find c and d.

c - d = -15.296
2c - d = -12.046

Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: 'sin(x)' and '|x|' (absolute value of x). All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve:

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 3 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: '-x' negative x,'|x|' (absolute value of x),'sin(x)' and 'x'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].
Function #2 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].
Function #3 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['c', 'b'].
<New Row>Kevin checked <Code secured door>, and found the result: This <Code secured door> is the only exit from this room. To unlock it and leave, you must enter the correct code.

**Observations:**
1. \( f_1(1) = -4 \) ⟹ \( a = -4 \)
2. \( f_2(1) = 6.524 \) ⟹ \( -4 \cdot 1 + b = 6.524 \) ⟹ \( b = 10.524 \)
3. \( f_3(0) = 0 \) ⟹ \( b = 0 \) (Contradiction)
4. \( f_3(1) = 2 \) ⟹ \( c = 2 \)
5. \( f_3(2) = 4 \) ⟹ \( 2c = 4 \)
6. \( f_2(\pi) = 12.566 \) ⟹ \( -4\pi + b = 12.566 \)

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 2 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: Only ""x^2"" (square of x) appears in these functions.. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].
Function #2 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].
<New Row>Kevin checked <Code secured door>, and found the result: This <Code secured door> is the only exit from this room. To unlock it and leave, you must enter the correct code. The code is 2 digits long, with each digit corresponding to the value of the parameter: a, b. You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>You assign the value 1 to x of the function #2, and then the function outputs 9.

2. \( g(2) = 4 \)
3. \( g(\pi) = 6.283185307179586 \)

**Calculations:**
1. \( a = 6.731767878463172 \)
2. \( b \cdot \sin(2) = 4 \Rightarrow b = \frac{4}{\sin(2)} \approx 4.604 \)

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 3 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: 'x',""x^2"" (square of x),'-x' negative x and '1/x'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c, d}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].
Function #2 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].

- Function #1: \( f_1(x) = 20x - 12 \)
- Function #2: \( f_2(x) = 2x \)
- Function #3: \( f_3(x) = \frac{c}{x} + bx + d \)

Given:
- \( f_3(1) = 7 \): \( c + b + d = 7 \)
- \( f_3(2) = -5.5 \): \( \frac{c}{2} + 2b + d = -5.5 \)
- \( f_3(3) = -15 \): \( \frac{c}{3} + 3b + d = -15 \)

**Planned Actions:**
1. Solve the system of equations for \( c \), \( b \), and \( d \).
2. Input code [2, a, c, d] into the Code secured door.

**Solving the system:**
1. \( c + b + d = 7 \)
2. \( \frac{c}{2} + 2b + d = -5.5 \)
3. \( \frac{c}{3} + 3b + d = -15 \)

From the first equation:
\[ d = 7 - c - b \]

Substitute \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ \frac{c}{2} + 2b + (7 - c - b) = -5.5 \]
\[ \frac{c}{2} + b + 7 - c = -5.5 \]
\[ -\frac{c}{2} + b = -12.5 \]
\[ c = 2b + 25 \]

Substitute \( c \) into the third equation:
\[ \frac{2b + 25}{3} + 3b + (7 - (2b + 25) - b) = -15 \]
\[ \frac{2b + 25}{3} + 3b + 7 - 3b - 25 = -15 \]
\[ \frac{2b + 25}{3} - 18 = -15 \]
\[ \frac{2b + 25}{3} = 3 \]
\[ 2b + 25 = 9 \]
\[ 2b = -16 \]
\[ b = -8 \]

Substitute \( b \) back to find \( c \) and \( d \):
\[ c = 2(-8) + 25 = 9 \]
\[ d = 7 - 9 - (-8) = 6 \]

**Next Action:**
4. Input code [2, a, 9, 6] into the Code secured door.

Since the second digit is incorrect, try \( a = 1 \):

- Function #3: \( f_3(x) = c \cdot x^2 + b \cdot x + d \)

**Planned Actions:**
1. Assign a value to the variable of Function #1 and see the output.
2. Assign a value to the variable of Function #2 and see the output.
3. Assign a value to the variable of Function #3 and see the output.

**1st Action:**
Assign \( x = 1 \) to Function #1 and observe the output.<New Row>**Current Hypothesis:**
- Function #1: \( f_1(x) = a \cdot x + b \)
- Function #2: \( f_2(x) = a \cdot x \)
- Function #3: \( f_3(x) = c \cdot x^2 + b \cdot x + d \)

**Observations:**
- \( f_1(1) = 8 \) implies \( a + b = 8 \)
- \( f_2(1) = 2 \) implies \( a = 2 \)
- \( f_3(1) = 7 \) implies \( c + b + d = 7 \)

**Deductions:**
- From \( f_2(1) = 2 \), \( a = 2 \)
- From \( f_1(1) = 8 \), \( 2 + b = 8 \) so \( b = 6 \)
- From \( f_3(1) = 7 \), \( c + 6 + d = 7 \) so \( c + d = 1 \)

**Planned Actions:**
1. Assign \( x = 2 \) to Function #3 and observe the output to solve for \( c \) and \( d \).

**Next Steps:**
1. Assign \( x = 2 \) to Function #3 and observe the output.

**Action:**
Assign \( x = 2 \) to Function #3 and observe the output.<New Row>**Current Hypothesis:**

**Observations:**
- \( f_3(2) = -5.5 \) implies \( 4c + 12 + d = -5.5 \)

**Deductions:**
- From \( c + d = 1 \) and \( 4c + d = -17.5 \):
  - Subtracting: \( 3c = -18.5 \) so \( c = -\frac{18.5}{3} = -6.17 \)

**Observations:**
- \( f_3(2) = -5.5 \) implies \( 4c + 12 + d = -5.5 \)
- Simplifying: \( 4c + d = -17.5 \)
- \( f_3(3) = -15 \) implies \( 9c + 18 + d = -15 \)
- Simplifying: \( 9c + d = -33 \)

**Deductions:**
- From \( 4c + d = -17.5 \) and \( 9c + d = -33 \):
  - Subtracting: \( 5c = -15.5 \) so \( c = -3.1 \)

- Function #2: \( f_2(x) = 2x \)
- Function #3: \( f_3(x) = c \cdot x^2 + 6x + d \)

**Observations:**
- \( f_3(2) = -5.5 \) implies \( 4c + 12 + d = -5.5 \)
- Simplifying: \( 4c + d = -17.5 \)
- \( f_3(3) = -15 \) implies \( 9c + 18 + d = -15 \)
- Simplifying: \( 9c + d = -33 \)

**Deductions:**
- From \( 4c + d = -17.5 \) and \( 9c + d = -33 \):
  - Subtracting: \( 5c = -15.5 \) so \( c = -3.1 \)
  - \( d = -17.5 - 4(-3.1) = -17.5 + 12.4 = -5.1 \)

**Planned Actions:**
1. Input code [2, 6, -3, -5] into the Code secured door.

[2, 6, -3, -5]<New Row>**Current Hypothesis:**
- Function #1: \( f_1(x) = 2x + 6 \)
- Function #2: \( f_2(x) = 2x \)
- Function #3: \( f_3(x) = -3.1x^2 + 6x - 5.1 \)

**Observations:**
- \( f_1(4) = 2(4) + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 \)
- \( f_1(4) = 104 \) contradicts the hypothesis.

**Revised Hypothesis:**
- Function #1: \( f_1(x) = ax + b \)
  - Given \( f_1(1) = 8 \) and \( f_1(4) = 104 \):
    - \( a + b = 8 \)
    - \( 4a + b = 104 \)
    - Solving: \( 3a = 96 \) so \( a = 32 \)
    - \( b = 8 - 32 = -24 \)
- Function #2: \( f_2(x) = 2x \)
- Function #3: \( f_3(x) = -3.1x^2 + 6x - 5.1 \)

- Function #1: \( f_1(x) = ax + b \)
  - Given \( f_1(2) = 28 \):
    - \( 2a + b = 28 \)
    - \( 4a - 24 = 104 \)
    - Solving: \( a = 32 \), \( b = -36 \)

[20, -12, c, d]<New Row>**Current Hypothesis:**
- Function #1: \( f_1(x) = 20x - 12 \)
- Function #2: \( f_2(x) = 2x \)
- Function #3: \( f_3(x) = \frac{c}{x} + bx + d \)

Given:
- \( f_3(1) = 7 \): \( c + b + d = 7 \)
- \( f_3(2) = -5.5 \): \( \frac{c}{2} + 2b + d = -5.5 \)
- \( f_3(3) = -15 \): \( \frac{c}{3} + 3b + d = -15 \)

**Planned Actions:**
1. Solve the system of equations for \( c \), \( b \), and \( d \).
2. Input code [2, 0, c, d] into the Code secured door.

**Solving the system:**
1. \( c + b + d = 7 \)
2. \( \frac{c}{2} + 2b + d = -5.5 \)
3. \( \frac{c}{3} + 3b + d = -15 \)

From the first equation:
\[ d = 7 - c - b \]

Substitute \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ \frac{c}{2} + 2b + (7 - c - b) = -5.5 \]
\[ \frac{c}{2} + b + 7 - c = -5.5 \]
\[ -\frac{c}{2} + b = -12.5 \]
\[ c = 2b + 25 \]

Substitute \( c \) into the third equation:
\[ \frac{2b + 25}{3} + 3b + (7 - (2b + 25) - b) = -15 \]
\[ \frac{2b + 25}{3} + 3b + 7 - 3b - 25 = -15 \]
\[ \frac{2b + 25}{3} - 18 = -15 \]
\[ \frac{2b + 25}{3} = 3 \]
\[ 2b + 25 = 9 \]
\[ 2b = -16 \]
\[ b = -8 \]

Substitute \( b \) back to find \( c \) and \( d \):
\[ c = 2(-8) + 25 = 9 \]
\[ d = 7 - 9 - (-8) = 6 \]

- \( f_3(3) = -15 \): \( \frac{c}{3} + 3b + d = -15 \)

**Planned Actions:**
1. Solve the system of equations for \( c \), \( b \), and \( d \).
2. Input code [2, a, c, d] into the Code secured door.

**Solving the system:**
1. \( c + b + d = 7 \)
2. \( \frac{c}{2} + 2b + d = -5.5 \)
3. \( \frac{c}{3} + 3b + d = -15 \)

From the first equation:
\[ d = 7 - c - b \]

Substitute \( d \) into the second equation:

\[ \frac{2b + 25}{3} + 3b + 7 - 3b - 25 = -15 \]
\[ \frac{2b + 25}{3} - 18 = -15 \]
\[ \frac{2b + 25}{3} = 3 \]
\[ 2b + 25 = 9 \]
\[ 2b = -16 \]
\[ b = -8 \]

Substitute \( b \) back to find \( c \) and \( d \):
\[ c = 2(-8) + 25 = 9 \]
\[ d = 7 - 9 - (-8) = 6 \]

- \( g(1) = 4 \)
- \( f(2) = 18.5 \)
- \( f(3) = 37.67 \)
- \( g(2) = 16 \)

From \( g(2) = 16 \):
\[ \frac{b}{2} = 16 \]
\[ b = 32 \]

Recalculate \( a \) using \( f(1) = 9 \):

- \( g(1) = 4 \)

From \( g(1) = 4 \), \( \frac{b}{1} = 4 \) implies \( b = 4 \).

Substitute \( b = 4 \) into \( f(1) = 9 \):

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 3 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: ""x^2"" (square of x),'x' and 'sin(x)'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c, d}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function No.1: f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c.
Function No.2: f(x) = a*x + d.
Function No.3: f(x) = c*sin(x).

The code is 4 digits long, with each digit corresponding to the value of the parameter: a, b, c, d. You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>.

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 2 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: '1/x' and ""x^2"" (square of x). All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function No.1: f(x) = a*1/x + b*x^2.
Function No.2: f(x) = b*x^2.
<New Row>Kevin checked <Code secured door>, and found the result: This <Code secured door> is the only exit from this room. To unlock it and leave, you must enter the correct code.
