We can try with another common variable value to see where that leads us.<New Row>Given that I provied 0.5 *pi to the first function and it was confirmed that the function has only 1 parameter 'a' and it returned 7 we can assume the form of function 1 is a * sin(x). For function 2 is has only 1 parameter b and we provided 1 for our variable x and it returned 2. Through this we can assume that the form of the function 2 is b * x or b * |x|.

For example yellow is the 3rd color of the rainbow so I can try to guess '333' to see if any of the digits are correct and continue from there.<New Row>The ywlloe painting was in the room called acrylic painting gallery. THis has 3 words and each word is made up of 7,8 and 7 letters respectively. Since the yellow painitng was ""hidden"" in there maybe I can input those numbers for another hint at the password?<New Row>Another thing I can try i is to determine the password by seeing that its called Morning Glory Acrylic Paint and its of yellow morning. I'll try counting letters again as there is no other yellow features<New Row>It tells us to focus on the color black. This color is usally associated with the night so if I can find items with these features I may be able to determine a password. Woods and silence might relate but that might be a reach. The password may relate to the order is was listed as well. So I'll first try to see whehter the items with the black features and their order placement is a valid password and then i'll letter count.<New Row>Now that it says to focus on green, there is a painting called Sapphire Night Oil Paint. The password has to be related to the color of the painting but what would each digit correspond to? There are 3 types of painting Oil, Acrylic and Water color. So maybe it could respond to the type of painting. SO maybe the digits could be the color, type and description.?",,0<step>1<step>2<step>3<step>6<step>6<step>7<step>8<step>9<step>13,
