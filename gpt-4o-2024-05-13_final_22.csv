You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>.

To unlock it and leave, you must enter the correct code. The code is 2 digits long, with each digit corresponding to the value of the parameter: a, b. You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 2 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: ""x^2"" (square of x) and '1/x'.

You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve:

The function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: Only 'x' appears in these functions.. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Funciton #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)).

You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>.

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Code secured door>, and found the result: This <Code secured door> is the only exit from this room. To unlock it and leave, you must enter the correct code. The code is 4 digits long, with each digit corresponding to the value of the parameter: a, b, c, d. You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 3 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: ""x^2"" (square of x),'x' and 'sin(x)'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c, d}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Funciton #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 3 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b', 'c'].

Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: 'sin(x)','x','1/x' and '|x|' (absolute value of x). All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Funciton #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].
Function #2 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b'].
Function #3 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].

You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>.

However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 3 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x.

All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Funciton #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve:

You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 2 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: 'sin(x)' and '1/x'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Funciton #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].

However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 3 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: ""x^2"" (square of x),'x','|x|' (absolute value of x) and '1/x'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c, d}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Funciton #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 3 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b', 'c'].
Function #2 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['d', 'b'].
Function #3 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b'].
