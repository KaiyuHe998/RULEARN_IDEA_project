I assume the password is related to the dominant colors in each painting. The hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" suggests blue is significant. Noticing the blue color in <Midnight Dance Oil Paint> and <River Reflections Watercolor Paint>, I propose the password consists of the number of blue-dominant paintings. There are two blue-dominant paintings, so my initial password is ""002"". I'll input this into the <Code Secured Door> and observe the result. If incorrect, I'll investigate other galleries and paintings to refine my assumption.<New Row>

My current assumption remains valid: the password is related to the dominant colors in each painting, and the hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" suggests blue is significant. Given the recent attempts, I'll refine my approach. Since the second digit ""0"" is correct, I'll focus on the paintings with blue-dominant colors. Noticing <Midnight Dance Oil Paint> and <River Reflections Watercolor Paint>, I propose the password consists of the number of paintings with blue-dominant colors. My next attempt will be ""012"". If incorrect, I'll reconsider the other paintings and colors.

Assumption: The password is related to the paintings' dominant colors. The hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" suggests blue is the key. Since there are three blue paintings, I assume each digit of the password corresponds to the number of paintings with a specific shade of blue: light (watercolor), dark (oil), and mid-tone (acrylic).

Plan: I will input ""231"" into the <Code Secured Door>, as there are 2 watercolor, 3 blue paintings in total, and 1 acrylic blue painting. If incorrect, I will investigate other galleries for more clues.<New Row>in

Currect assumption: The password is related to the paintings' dominant colors. The new hint ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth"" suggests yellow is the key. Since there is 1 yellow painting, I assume each digit of the password corresponds to the number of paintings with a specific shade of yellow.

Plan: I will count the shades of yellow in the paintings and input the corresponding password into the <Code Secured Door>. Since there is only 1 yellow painting, the password might be ""111"". I will try this combination first.<New Row>108

Assumption: The password is related to the paintings' dominant colors. The hint ""Focus on blue"" suggests that blue is crucial. I observed that two paintings feature blue as the primary color: <Midnight Dance Oil Paint> and <Winter Chill Acrylic Paint>.

My assumption: The password is related to the paintings' dominant colors. The new hint ""Focus on yellow"" suggests yellow is crucial. I noticed no yellow paintings in this gallery. I'll search other galleries for yellow-themed paintings or connections. Since yellow is now the focus, I'll revise my password guess based on new observations.

Plan: Explore other galleries for yellow paintings or connections. Once found, create a new password guess and input it into the Code Secured Door.<New Row>

My revised assumption: The password is related to the paintings, but not limited to the dominant colors. The hint ""Focus on yellow"" suggests exploring other galleries for yellow connections. Since no yellow paintings are in this gallery, I'll search for yellow-themed art or artist connections.

Kevin's current assumption is that the painting with black color (<Night Sky Acrylic Paint>) is related to the password. His plan is to study this painting and find any potential clues related to the password. Since the hint changed from ""Focus on yellow"" to ""Focus on black"", the assumption seems valid. Next, Kevin will examine the painting more closely, checking for any hidden patterns, numbers, or symbols that could be connected to the password.<New Row>You should select an action and use one integer to respond your selection. But your input None is not an integer selection<New Row>The Code Secured Door is so vaild that it seems could not be opened by brute force.","

Based on the hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth,"" I assume the password is related to the count or sequence of blue-colored paintings. I notice that there are four blue paintings: <Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint>, <Bluebell Woods Acrylic Paint>, <Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint>, and <River Reflections Watercolor Paint>. My initial assumption is that the password is the sequence of these paintings (e.g., 1-2-3-4). I plan to input this password into the <Code Secured Door>. If it doesn't work, I'll re-examine the paintings to see if I can find a different pattern or connection.<New Row>– As I only have one attempt left, I revised my assumption. I realize that the hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" might be related to the colors within the blue paintings rather than their sequence. I notice that <Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint> and <River Reflections Watercolor Paint> have a similar shade of blue, while <Bluebell Woods Acrylic Paint> and <Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint> have a lighter shade. My new plan is to input a code combining these similarities, such as 12 or 21, and test it on the <Code Secured Door>.<New Row>
My current assumption is no longer valid since the password has changed and the hint now says ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth."" This indicates a new relationship between the yellow colors in the paintings. My revised assumption is that the password is related to the yellow shades in the paintings. Next, I will examine the paintings with yellow hues, such as <Forest Canopy Acrylic Paint>, <Jungle Mist Acrylic Paint>, and potentially find similarities or patterns in their colors. I will then create a new code based on these observations and attempt to open the <Code Secured Door>.<New Row>

My current assumption is that the password is related to the yellow shades in the paintings. I will examine the paintings with yellow hues, such as <Forest Canopy Acrylic Paint> and <Jungle Mist Acrylic Paint>. I'll look for similarities or patterns in their colors and create a new code based on these observations. Since I haven't found any yellow shades yet, my next step is to thoroughly examine the paintings again, focusing on the yellow colors, and identify any connections or patterns that could lead to the correct password.<New Row>ibly 



My new assumption is that the password is not related to the yellow shades in the paintings. The hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" suggests that the password is related to the blue colors in the paintings. My next step is to examine the blue-colored paintings, such as <Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint>, <Bluebell Woods Acrylic Paint>, <River Reflections Watercolor Paint>, and <Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint>, and look for similarities or patterns in their colors. Then, I'll create a new code based on these observations.<New Row>.<New Row>ICALLYelijke 
Kevin's current assumption is that the paintings with blue colors are related to the password. But now the hint is ""Focus on black it hides the truth"". This assumption is no longer valid.

My initial assumption is that the password relates to the dominant color of each painting. The hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" suggests that blue is a crucial color.

Current assumption: The password relates to the dominant color of each painting, with blue being a crucial color. Plan: Test the password ""225"" as each of the blue-predominant paintings corresponds to the numbers 2, 2, and 5, respectively, in the order they appear in the room. If incorrect, revisit the paintings and look for any other patterns or connections between the dominant colors and the paintings' numbers.

Kevin noticed that there are 3 paintings with blue as dominant color (<Sapphire Night Oil Paint>,<Winter Chill Acrylic Paint>,<Coastal Serenity Oil Paint>) and 2 paintings with yellow as dominant color (<Morning Glory Acrylic Paint>,<Flower Oil Paint>). Then, Kevin ordered these paintings by room position from left to right (<Flower Oil Paint>,<Morning Glory Acrylic Paint>,<Coastal Serenity Oil Paint>,<Sapphire Night Oil Paint>,<Winter Chill Acrylic Paint>). Next, Kevin took the first digit of each painting's position from the ordered list (1,2,3,4,5). Then, Kevin formed a password by taking the first digit of each painting's position.

My current assumption is that Function #1 is a*x and Function #2 is b*sin(x). To verify, I will input x = 1 into the computer to get the output of both functions.

My current assumption holds: Function #1 is a*x and Function #2 is b*sin(x). From the outputs, I deduce that a = 9 (since 1*x = 9) and b = 3 (since 1*sin(1) ≈ 3.365883939231586).

Check if there's a specific order or a specific element in each painting that could relate to a 3-digit password. If no connection is found, explore the other galleries to see if there are any other blue-themed paintings or hints that could help uncover the password.<New Row>zent: Here is my revised assumption and plan:

Assumption: The password is related to the paintings with a dominant blue color.

Plan: I will investigate the blue-themed paintings' details, such as the number of objects, shapes, or colors, to find a connection to a 3-digit password. I will also check if there's a specific order or pattern among the blue paintings. If no connection is found, I will explore other galleries for additional blue-themed paintings or hints. My next step is to examine each blue painting more closely, taking note of any potential patterns or clues.<New Row>But make sure to answer the questions in detail:
What is your current assumption? 
What are your next steps?

My current assumption is that the password is related to the paintings with a dominant color, which is now yellow according to the new message ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth."" 

My next steps are to examine the yellow-themed paintings, specifically <Morning Glory Acrylic Paint> and <Summer Fields Watercolor Paint>, and investigate their details, such as the number of objects, shapes, or colors, to find a connection to a 3-digit password. I will also check if there's a specific order or pattern among the yellow paintings.<New Row>.<New Row>ments from your prior assumption, and describe the next steps you plan to take towards your goal.

Current Assumption: Based on the paintings, the password is related to the colors (blue, black, yellow) 
Plan: Kevin has found that the paintings contain the colors blue, black, and yellow. Under the new hint ""Focus on black it hides the truth,"" Kevin should check the paintings with black colors (<Urban Shadows Oil Paint>, <Night Sky Acrylic Paint>) to find the next clue. The correct sequence of colors could be the password, so Kevin should also review the previous attempts and tries to find a connection between the colors and the password.<New Row> 

Current Assumption: Based on the paintings, the password is related to the colors (blue, black, yellow) 
Plan:  Since Kevin has found that the paintings contain the colors blue, black, and yellow, and considering the new hint ""Focus on black it hides the truth,"" Kevin should review the previous attempts and tries to find a connection between the colors and the password. Checking the paintings with the black colors (<Urban Shadows Oil Paint>, <Night Sky Acrylic Paint>) may provide the next clue. Additionally, Kevin should inspect if there is a sequence of colors correlation with correct digits in previous attempts.",,0<step>0<step>3<step>3<step>8<step>8,

My current assumption is that each function is a linear combination of monomials with coefficients/constant terms being the parameters a, b, c, d. 
My plan is to assign values to x and evaluate each function, then analyze the outputs to deduce the exact forms of each function and the values of the parameters. I will start by assigning x=1 and evaluate each function to obtain a system of equations involving a, b, c, d. I will then solve this system to obtain the values of the parameters. If my solution is incorrect, I will enter the values into the <Code secured door> to test my result.<New Row>te at all observations, both recent and prior. Finally, provide a plan for your next steps. 

My current assumption remains valid. Function #1: ax^2 + bx + c = 18. Function #2: ax + d = 6. Function #3: c = 0. From the door response, I know 9 is the correct third digit. I will try x=0 for function #1 and function #2 to obtain another system of equations. Then, I will solve the systems to obtain the values of a, b, c, d. My next attempt to open the door will be with the new values.",,0<step>7,

Assumption: The password relates to the dominant colors of the paintings. The hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" suggests blue is a crucial color. I notice that three paintings feature blue as the primary color: <Coastal Serenity Oil Paint>, <Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint>, and <Sapphire Night Oil Paint>.

If incorrect, re-explore the room for more clues.<New Row>                                                                             <New Row>diator Review:

My current assumption is: the password is related to the number of paintings of a certain color. 

The previous note said, ""Focus on blue,"" so I thought the password was related to the number of blue paintings (3). However, the hint changed to ""Focus on yellow"" and then ""Focus on black,"" suggesting that the password is not necessarily related to the number of paintings of one specific color.

My next step is to re-examine the paintings and find a new connection between the color and the password. I'll analyze each painting again, considering the changing hints.<New Row> 
My current assumption is: the password is related to the dominant color of each painting.

My next step is to re-examine the paintings and find a new connection between the color and the password. I'll count the number of dominant colors. Blue is dominant in 4 paintings, yellow in 2 paintings, green in 1 painting, and black in 0 paintings. My next step is to input the password as ""421"" and see if it's correct.<New Row>

My current assumption is that the password relates to the dominant blue color in some paintings. The hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" suggests that blue is a crucial element.

My current assumption is still that the password relates to the dominant blue color in some paintings. The incorrect password ""453"" leads me to suspect that the correct password is more specific. My new plan is to analyze the remaining paintings for a pattern or connection related to blue that I might have missed.

My original assumption, which was no longer valid, was that focus on blue would reveal the password.

My new assumption is that the password is related to the yellow-coloured paintings, and I plan to examine <Summer Fields Watercolor Paint> and <Morning Glory Acrylic Paint> more closely to discover any hidden clues or relationships that could lead me to the correct password.<New Row>isí

My current assumption is that both functions are combinations of the monomials ""x^2"" and ""1/x"" with coefficients and constants a and b. Based on the parameters listed, I hypothesize that Function #1 is ""ax^2 + b"" and Function #2 is ""b/x"". My next step is to assign a value to x, such as x=2, and evaluate both functions to get equations involving a and b. Then, I will input the possible values of a and b into the <Code secured door> to test my assumptions.<New Row>

My current assumption remains valid: Function #1 is ""ax^2 + b"" and Function #2 is ""b/x"". With x=2, Function #1 outputs 26, and with x=1, Function #2 outputs 4. I will now try to solve for a and b using these equations. My next step is to set up a system of equations using the output values and solve for a and b. If my calculations yield integer values within the 1-9 range, I will input them into the <Code secured door> in alphabetical order.<New Row>
My current assumption remains valid: Function #1 is ""ax^2 + b"" and Function #2 is ""b/x"". With x=2, Function #1 outputs 26, and with x=1, Function #2 outputs 4. I will set up a system of equations: 2a + b = 26 and b = 4. Solving for a and b, I get a = 11 and b = 4. Since a is out of range, I'll revise my assumption. Next, I'll try to modify the functions to fit the given outputs and then input the calculated values into the <Code secured door> in alphabetical order.<New Row>icamente.Now you have to input the code in the Code secured door and you need to determine the value of 'a' and 'b'. 
My current assumption is that Function #1 is ""ax^2 + b"" and Function #2 is ""b/x"". I will now assume that the coefficients of x^2 and 1/x are possibly also b and a, respectively. Modifying my equations: 4a + b = 26, and a = 4. Solving, I get a = 4, b = 2. I will input 24 into the Code secured door.

 
itinDisregard the previous response. My current assumption is that Function #1 is ""ax^2 + b"" and Function #2 is ""b/x"". I will modify my equations: 4a + b = 26, and a = 4. Solving, I get a = 4, b = 2. I will input 24 into<New Row> the code secured door says that your first digit 2 is incorrect, but your second digit 4 is correct. So my assumption is still valid.

My current assumption is that the password is related to the dominant colors in the paintings in the Oil Painting Gallery.

My plan is to input ""214"" into the <Code Secured Door> based on the yellow and blue colors in the paintings. I want to investigate the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery to confirm or contradict my assumption and to gather more information about the password.<New Row>-the revised assumption and next steps should be concise.

My revised assumption is that the password is not related to the dominant colors in the paintings, as the hint changed from ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" to ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth"". I believe the password is related to the particular paintings themselves, not their colors. My next steps are to re-examine the paintings in the Oil Painting Gallery, Watercolour Gallery, and Acrylic Painting Gallery to find connections between them and the password. I will then input the new password into the <Code Secured Door> to try and open it.<New Row>.|My revised assumption is that the password is related to the number of paintings with yellow dominant color, and the paintings with blue dominant color in the galleries. My next steps are to count the paintings with yellow and blue dominant colors in each gallery, and then use this information to form a new password. I will then input the new password into the <Code Secured Door> to try and open it.<New Row>
My revised assumption is that the password is related to the number of paintings with yellow dominant color, and the paintings with blue dominant color in the galleries. 

Based on my observations, I count 2 yellow paintings (Lemon Grove Oil Paint and Summer Fields Watercolor Paint) and 2 blue paintings (Midnight Dance Oil Paint and River Reflections Watercolor Paint). 

My next steps are to form a new password using this information, such as 22 or 222, and input it into the <Code Secured Door> to try and open it.<New Row>bc

Revised Assumption:
Since the new hint says ""Focus on black it hides the truth,"" I assume the password is related to the number of paintings with black dominant color in the galleries.

Plan:
Count the number of paintings with black dominant color. Enter the new password based on this information, such as a single digit or a combination of digits. Input the code into the <Code Secured Door> to try and open it. If incorrect, revise the assumption and plan accordingly.<New Row>
Current Assumption:
The password is related to the number of paintings with black dominant color in the galleries.

Plan:
Count the paintings with black dominant color: 1 (<Midnight Dance Oil Paint> has a blue night sky, not black; <River Reflections Watercolor Paint> has a blue river, not black; no other paintings have black dominant color). Enter the password as ""1"" or a combination of digits including ""1"". Input the code into the <Code Secured Door> and try to open it. If incorrect, revise the assumption and plan accordingly.",,0<step>4<step>4<step>4<step>9<step>10,

My assumption is that the password for the Code Secured Door relates to the paintings in the Oil Painting Gallery, specifically the dominant colors of each painting. The note suggests focusing on blue, which makes me think of Sapphire Night Oil Paint. I'll test the password ""250"" (2 being the second painting, 5 being the color code for blue, and 0 for the absence of other colors). If this doesn't work, I'll investigate the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery for additional clues.<New Row>

**Current Assumption:** The password relates to the paintings in the Oil Painting Gallery, specifically the dominant colors of each painting. 

**Revised Plan:** Since the hint changed to ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth,"" I will investigate the galleries for yellow-dominant paintings. Inspect the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery for paintings with yellow as the primary color. If I find a painting, use its position and color code to form the password (e.g., painting position-color code-0). If not, revisit the Oil Painting Gallery to explore other clues. With the new hint, I will try to find connections between the paintings and the password.<New Row>skyt

**Current Assumption:** The password relates to the paintings in all galleries, specifically the dominant colors of each painting, focusing on the hinted color.

**Revised Plan:** Inspect the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery for paintings with black as the primary color, following the new hint.

Based on the observation that the note says ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" and the oil painting <Midnight Dance Oil Paint> having a blue night sky with moon, my initial assumption is that the password is related to blue colors in the paintings. Specifically, I assume the password is the number of blue-colored paintings in each gallery. My plan is to investigate the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery to count the number of blue-colored paintings and formulate the password. I will input the calculated password into the <Code Secured Door> to verify my assumption.<New Row>ustomed to:

My current assumption is no longer valid due to the new hint, ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth."" This indicates a shift from blue to yellow. I will revise my assumption: the password is related to the number of yellow-colored paintings in each gallery. My new plan is to re-investigate the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery, counting the yellow-colored paintings to formulate a new password. I will then input the calculated password into the <Code Secured Door> to verify my revised assumption.<New Row>ined to:

My current assumption is that the password is related to the number of yellow-colored paintings in each gallery. However, attempting to input a code based on this assumption was incorrect. I will revise my assumption: the password is still related to yellow-colored paintings, but it requires a more specific count. My new plan is to investigate the yellow-colored paintings in each gallery, considering the specifics of each painting, such as the dominant shade of yellow, to formulate a new password. I will then input the calculated password into the <Code Secured Door> to verify my revised assumption.<New Row>
My current assumption is that the password is related to yellow-colored paintings, but I must refine my count. I will investigate each gallery, considering dominant shades of yellow, to formulate a new password.

I will then input the calculated password into the <Code Secured Door> to verify my revised assumption.

My current assumption: The password is related to yellow-colored paintings.

New plan:

I will re-examine each gallery, counting the number of paintings with dominant yellow shades. I'll note the specific shades to create a new password. I'll then input the calculated password into the <Code Secured Door> to verify my revised assumption.

Re-examine Oil Painting Gallery, Watercolour Gallery, and Acrylic Painting Gallery, focusing on yellow elements. Update the password count and try inputting it into the <Code Secured Door>.<New Row>.<New Row>e: I will not be able to respond again if you ask for more information.

Based on my previous observations, my current assumption is that paintings with dominant blue colors are related to the password, and the hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" confirms this.

My next step is to explore the galleries again, focusing on yellow-dominant paintings to find a connection to the password.<New Row>veillance camerasdiscussed

Assumption: The password relates to the dominant colors of the paintings. The hint ""focus on blue"" suggests that blue is a key color.

Initial assumption: The password consists of the numbers of paintings with dominant blue colors.

Plan: I will input ""3"" into the <Code Secured Door>, as there are three paintings with dominant blue colors (<Bluebell Woods Acrylic Paint>, <Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint>, and <River Reflections Watercolor Paint>). If incorrect, I will investigate the remaining galleries to see if there are any other blue-dominant paintings or patterns.<New Row>

My assumption remains valid: The password relates to the dominant colors of the paintings, and ""focus on blue"" hints at blue being key. Since the password has 3 digits, I'll modify my assumption: The password consists of the numbers of paintings with dominant blue colors, followed by the total number of paintings, and a third digit representing a specific blue-dominant painting. My next step is to re-examine the paintings and assign numerical values accordingly. I'll then input the revised password into the <Code Secured Door>.<New Row>.<New Row>
Current Assumption: The password is related to the colors and types of paintings.

Plan: Since the hint changed to ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth,"" I'll re-examine the paintings. I noticed that <Morning Glory Acrylic Paint> is the only yellow painting. I'll try to find a connection between yellow and the correct password.

Next Steps: Check <Morning Glory Acrylic Paint> again, looking for any hidden clues or patterns. If none are found, review the other paintings to see if any yellow undertones or hints are present. Use this new information to formulate a new password attempt.<New Row>ptime try

My initial assumption is that the password relates to the dominant colors of the paintings. The hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" suggests that blue is a crucial color. I notice that <Coastal Serenity Oil Paint>, <Sapphire Night Oil Paint>, and <Winter Chill Acrylic Paint> all feature blue as the primary color. I plan to input the password ""255"" (representing the 2 blue oil paintings and 5 blue-accented paintings in total). If this attempt fails, I will investigate other galleries to see if there are more blue-dominant paintings that could help decipher the password.<New Row>nton

Assumption: The password relates to the dominant color of the paintings. The hint ""Focus on blue"" suggests that blue is a key color. I'll input ""212"" into the <Code Secured Door>, assuming the password corresponds to the number of blue paintings (2 oil, 1 acrylic, 1 watercolor).

Plan: Verify by re-checking the paintings to ensure no other colors have a similar pattern. If incorrect, investigate other galleries for additional paintings or clues. Next, I'll examine the paintings' titles and descriptions to see if any numerical patterns emerge. If still stuck, I'll explore other color combinations.<New Row> image
My current assumption remains: The password relates to the dominant color of the paintings. The hint ""Focus on blue"" suggests that blue is a key color. 

Since Kevin's attempt ""223"" was incorrect, I will revise my assumption. There are 2 oil paintings and 3 acrylic/acrylic&watercolor paintings with dominant blue color. So, my new assumption is: The password corresponds to the number of blue oil paintings, blue acrylic paintings, and blue watercolor paintings.

Next, I'll input ""233"" into the <Code Secured Door> to test this assumption.<New Row>. Here is my revised assumption and plan:
Upon reviewing the new hint ""Focus on yellow,"" I realize my previous assumption still holds. Since Kevin's attempt ""233"" was incorrect, I will revise my assumption to consider both blue and yellow. There are 1 yellow, 2 blue oil paintings, and 2 blue acrylic paintings. My new assumption is: The password corresponds to the number of yellow paintings, blue oil paintings, and blue acrylic paintings.

Next, I'll input ""122"" into the <Code Secured Door> to test this assumption.<New Row>Here is my revised assumption and plan:
My assumption still holds: Password corresponds to the number of yellow, blue oil, and blue acrylic paintings. The previous attempts showed that the first and third digits are not ""1"" and ""2."" My next input will be ""323."" If this is incorrect, I'll revise my assumption again.<New Row>actice constraint
My assumption needs revision: The password no longer corresponds to the number of yellow, blue oil, and blue acrylic paintings.

My next input will be based on this new observation.<New Row>emem
My assumption: The password corresponds to the number of yellow, black, and a third color paintings.

My assumption is that the password is related to the dominant colours of the paintings. The hint ""Focus on blue"" suggests that blue is crucial. I noticed that the <Midnight Dance Oil Paint> has a blue night sky. I plan to enter ""blue""-related digits (e.g., 250, representing the 250th shade of blue) into the <Code Secured Door>. If that fails, I'll investigate the Watercolour and Acrylic Painting Galleries to find more clues about the relationships between the paintings and the password.<New Row>

My revised assumption is that the password is related to the dominant colours of the paintings, but the hint ""Focus on [colour]"" suggests a more specific connection. With the new hint ""Focus on yellow"", I plan to investigate the paintings in the Watercolour and Acrylic Painting Galleries to find a yellow-dominant piece. I will look for any yellow-related digits (e.g., 220, representing a shade of yellow) and input them into the <Code Secured Door>. This should give me a better chance of unlocking the door.<New Row>colnclude all your observations

My current assumption is still valid, as I've found yellow-dominant paintings in the galleries. The correct yellow-related digits may be hidden in these paintings. My plan is to re-examine <Meadow Breeze Watercolor Paint> and <Winter Chill Acrylic Paint> to find any yellow-related digits. I will then input these digits into the <Code Secured Door>.

Assumption: The password is related to the paintings' dominant colors. The hint ""Focus on blue"" suggests the sapphire night oil painting is crucial. I assume the password consists of the numbers corresponding to the colors' wavelengths (nanometers).

My plan is to assign an arbitrary value to x, say x=1, and input the resulting outputs into the <Code secured door> to test my assumption. If incorrect, I'll try to deduce the correct values by analyzing the error messages. My current input would be a random guess, e.g., a=3, b=5, c=7.",,0,

Current Assumption: My assumption is that the password is related to the dominant color of the paintings. However, since the hint has changed to ""Focus on yellow,"" I now believe the password might be the number of yellow-dominant paintings in the gallery.

Next steps: I plan to investigate the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery again to see if there are any yellow-dominant paintings. If I find none, I will re-examine the Midnight Dance Oil Paint to ensure it doesn't have any yellow undertones.

Current Assumption: My assumption is that the password is related to the blue-dominant paintings in the gallery.

Next steps: Count the number of blue-dominant paintings in each gallery: Watercolour Gallery (3) and Acrylic Painting Gallery (2). However, since the password was incorrect, I will revise my assumption.

Revised Assumption: My assumption is that the password is not directly related to the number of blue-dominant paintings. 

Next steps: Review all observations and revisit the note that says ""Focus on blue it hides the truth."" I will look for other connections between the blue-dominant paintings and the password.<New Row>055

Current Assumption: The password is related to the blue-dominant paintings in the gallery, focusing on the number and characteristics of the blue-dominant paintings.

Next steps: Review all observations and revisit the note ""Focus on blue it hides the truth.""

Compare the blue-dominant paintings in Watercolour Gallery (3) and Acrylic Painting Gallery (2) to find a pattern or clue.<New Row>aviours:

Current Assumption: The new hint suggests that the password is related to black-dominant paintings.

Next steps: Revisit the observations in the Watercolour Gallery (0) and Acrylic Painting Gallery (1) to find black-dominant paintings.

Good morning! I observe that each function has a unique set of parameters. This leads me to believe that the functions are relatively simple. I hypothesize that Function #1 is ax + b, Function #2 is ax + c, and Function #3 is c. My plan is to input x = 1 into each function, which should yield outputs like a + b, a + c, and c. I will then analyze these outputs to determine a, b, and c. Next, I will input these values into the <Code secured door> in alphabetical order to test my result.<New Row>f you think you need more space, please inform the hosteer.
I'll revise my previous assumption based on the new outputs. Since Function #3 has only one term and outputs 1.682941969615793, I believe c = 2. Now, let's analyze the outputs of Function #1 and Function #2. I'll set up the equations: a + b = 14 and a + c = 11. Substituting c = 2, I get a + b = 14 and a + 2 = 11. Solving, I obtain a = 9 and b = 5. My plan is to input these values into the <Code secured door> in alphabetical order: a=9, b=5, c=2.<New Row>so you have enough space to elaborate if needed.

Next, I plan to assign x = 1 to each function to generate outputs. By analyzing these outputs, I can deduce the values of a, b, and c. Then, I will input these values into the <Code secured door> in alphabetical order to test my assumption. If incorrect, I will adjust my hypothesis and repeat the process, ensuring I don't exceed the 4-attempt limit.<New Row> 
My current assumption remains valid, but I need to revise my approach. From Function #3, I deduce that a = 4. For Function #1, the output 8.365883939231587 suggests that b*sin(1) contributes significantly, implying b > 1. Similarly, the output 5 from Function #2 suggests that c and b are not negligible. My next step is to assign different values to x for Function #1 to isolate the effects of a, b, and c. I'll analyze the outputs to refine my estimates of b and c, then input them into the door in alphabetical order.",,0<step>6,

Specifically analyzing the blue paintings in each gallery: in Oil Painting Gallery there is one blue painting (<Sapphire Night Oil Paint>). In Watercolour Gallery, there are two blue paintings (<Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint>, and <Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint>).

So I will check the blue painting first. My initial assumption is that the password is related to the blue painting. As the blue painting is an oil painting of a blue night sky, I will input the password ""212"" into the <Code Secured Door>, which corresponds to the 21st letter 'U' and 2nd letter 'B' in the alphabet. I will test this assumption first, and then explore other galleries if it is incorrect.<New Row>

My assumption remains valid: the password is related to the blue painting. Since the third digit ""2"" is correct, I will focus on modifying the first two digits. My new plan is to analyze the blue painting further, considering the phrase ""Focus on blue it hides the truth."" Specifically, I will count the number of stars, moon phases, or other details in the painting that could correspond to the first two digits. I will then input the revised password into the <Code Secured Door>.<New Row>
My current assumption remains valid: the password is related to the blue painting. Since the third digit ""2"" is correct, I'll focus on modifying the first two digits. I'll analyze the blue painting further, counting the number of stars, moon phases, or other details that could correspond to the first two digits. I'll input the revised password into the <Code Secured Door>. Specifically, I'll count the seven stars and two moon phases in the painting, considering combinations like 72 or 27. I'll then try these passwords, using my two remaining attempts.<New Row>

My current assumption is no longer valid, as the password has changed and the new hint focuses on the yellow painting. I revise my assumption to: the password is related to the yellow painting. I'll analyze the yellow paintings, counting details like lemons or flowers, to determine the correct digits. My plan is to examine the yellow paintings, specifically counting the number of lemons in <Lemon Grove Oil Paint> and flowers in <Flower Oil Paint>, to create a new password. I'll input this new password into the <Code Secured Door>.<New Row>92 words : 
My current assumption is no longer valid, as the password has changed and the new hint focuses on the black paintings. I revise my assumption to: the password is related to the black paintings. I'll analyze the black paintings in the gallery to determine the correct digits. My plan is to examine the black paintings, specifically counting any notable details, to create a new password. I'll input this new password into the <Code Secured Door>. I'll start by examining the Watercolour Gallery paintings.<New Row>  
My current assumption is still valid: the password is related to the black paintings. Since I'm in the Watercolour Gallery, I'll examine the paintings here. I notice that there are no black paintings in this room. I'll search the other rooms for black paintings. My next step is to return to the Oil Painting Gallery and check for black paintings. I'll review the paintings I've already seen and look for any details related to black.  If I find a connection, I'll create a new password and input it into the Code Secured Door.<New Row> the hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" points to blue paintings.   


I revise my assumption: the password is related to the blue paintings. Since I'm in the Watercolour Gallery, I'll examine the blue paintings here. I notice that there are two blue paintings: <Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint> and <Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint>. My next step is to return to the Oil Painting Gallery and check if there's a blue painting. I'll review the paintings I've already seen and look for any details related to blue. If I find a connection, I'll create a new password and input it into the Code Secured Door.<New Row> Nobel thinkers make mistakes, but they learn from them. Revised assumption: The hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" points to blue paintings. Since I've found blue paintings in both Watercolour and Oil Painting Galleries, I'll review them for any connections. My next action is to examine <Sapphire Night Oil Paint> and <Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint>, and <Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint> for any details that can help me create a new password. I'll then input the password into the Code Secured Door.<New Row>oardoor.

Revised assumption:  The hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" points to blue paintings. The password consists of three digits and each digit is associated with the number of blue paintings in each gallery.

Next step: Count the blue paintings in each gallery. For Oil Painting Gallery, there is one blue painting (<Sapphire Night Oil Paint>). For Watercolour Gallery, there are two blue paintings (<Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint>, and <Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint>). I will input the password 122 into the Code Secured Door.<New Row> 
Revised assumption: The hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" points to blue paintings. The password consists of three digits, but each digit is not directly associated with the number of blue paintings in each gallery. Instead, the passwords are somehow related to the blue paintings.

Next step: Re-analyze the blue paintings in each gallery to find a connection between them and the password. For Oil Painting Gallery, there is one blue painting (<Sapphire Night Oil Paint>). For Watercolour Gallery, there are two blue paintings (<Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint>, and <Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint>). Analyze the characteristics of these blue paintings to find a connection to the password.<New Row> did not want you to write many words.

Assumption: The password is related to the dominant colors of the paintings.

Based on the hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth,"" I suspect that blue is a key color. Noticing that there are two blue-themed paintings (<Coastal Serenity Oil Paint> and <Sapphire Night Oil Paint>), I hypothesize that the password might be the number of blue paintings (2) followed by the number of paintings with other dominant colors (2 for yellow, 2 for other colors).

Next, I'll input ""221"" into the <Code Secured Door> and observe the result. If incorrect, I'll re-examine the paintings and adjust my assumption.<New Row>5423624

My current assumption is still valid, as the new hint ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth"" suggests that we should examine the paintings with yellow dominant colors. Given the previous results, I'll re-examine the paintings and adjust my assumption.

Next, I'll count the yellow paintings (<Lemon Grove Oil Paint> and <Flower Oil Paint>) and other dominant colors, then input the new password into the <Code Secured Door>. I'll focus on the yellow paintings and adjust my assumption accordingly.<New Row> My assumption remains valid as the hint changes to ""Focus on black it hides the truth"".

Assumption: The password is related to the number of blue-colored paintings in the gallery.

Plan: Input ""3"" into the <Code Secured Door>, as there are three blue-colored paintings (<Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint>, <Bluebell Woods Acrylic Paint>, and <River Reflections Watercolor Paint>). I have checked all the paintings in the current gallery, but I haven't explored other galleries.

Assumption: The password is related to the number of yellow-colored paintings in the gallery.

Plan: Re-examine the paintings to identify the yellow paintings. Count the number of yellow paintings and input the digit into the <Code Secured Door>.

Currently, I will check each painting again to see if I can find any yellow-colored paintings.<New Row>Progress update. Note: what is the reply by Kevin following is the reply:

Assumption: The password is related to the total number of paintings having dominant blue color.

Plan: Count the total number of paintings having dominant blue color and input the digit into the <Code Secured Door>. Review each painting again to verify the dominant color.

Reasoning: I revised my assumption as I realized that previous hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" points to dominant blue color paintings, not yellow. I will check each painting again to find the total number of paintings having dominant blue color.<New Row>
Current Assumption: The password is related to the total number of paintings having dominant blue color is no longer valid.

Revised Assumption: The password is related to the total number of paintings having dominant black color.

Plan: Count the total number of paintings having dominant black color and input the digit into the <Code Secured Door>. Review each painting again to verify the dominant color.

Reasoning: The new hint ""Focus on black it hides the truth"" points to dominant black color paintings. I will check each painting again to find the total number of paintings having dominant black color.<New Row>età

Revised Assumption: The password is related to the total number of paintings having dominant black color.

Plan: Count the total number of paintings having dominant black color. Only the Night Sky Acrylic Paint has dominant black color. The digit is 1. Input 101 into the <Code Secured Door>.<New Row>o

My initial assumption is that the password is related to the number of blue-colored paintings in the gallery. I've identified 5 blue paintings: Ocean Oil Paint, Sapphire Night Oil Paint, Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint, Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint, and Winter Chill Acrylic Paint. I'll input the password ""505"" into the Code Secured Door, as 5 is the number of blue paintings. If incorrect, I'll investigate the other galleries to see if there are more blue paintings. I'll also re-examine the hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" to see if I've misinterpreted its meaning.<New Row>

My current assumption is still that the password is related to the blue-colored paintings. However, since the initial password ""505"" was incorrect, I need to revisit my approach. I'll re-examine the hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" and the blue paintings. I'll count the blue hues in each painting, rather than just the number of blue paintings. My next step is to re-examine each blue painting and count the dominant blue hues. Then, I'll try to create a new password based on these counts and input it into the Code Secured Door.<New Row>. Since the password has changed, I need to revise my assumption. My new assumption is that the password is related to the yellow-colored paintings. I'll re-examine the hint ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth"" and count the dominant yellow hues in each yellow painting. Then, I'll try to create a new password based on these counts and input it into the Code Secured Door. 

Next, I'll check the yellow paintings, count the yellow hues, and create a new password.<New Row>led from the paintings. I will input the new password and test it. 
Current assumption: The password is related to the yellow-colored paintings.
Plan: Count the dominant yellow hues in each yellow painting and create a new password based on these counts. Next, I'll input the new password into the Code Secured Door and see if it's correct. By examining the yellow paintings, I'll refine my assumption and adjust my strategy accordingly.<New Row>adderPlease have in mind: Review your previous observations and plan accordingly. Manage your attempts and modify your strategy efficiently.-------------------------

**Current assumption:** The password is related to the black-colored paintings.

**Plan:** Count the dominant black hues in each black painting and create a new password based on these counts. Next, I'll input the new password into the Code Secured Door and see if it's correct.

You tried too many times, the value of parameters have been reassigned(Only the value of parameters changed, the functions stays the same). And the password of the door changed accordingly, you may need to keep on interacting with the <Computer> and decode the password.
You just updated your plan and your assumption following is your new assumption and plan: nj

My assumption is not valid. Based on recent observations, I revise my assumption: b = 4, but a is unknown. From Function #1, I know a*sin(1) + b = 4.841470984807897, but without knowing a, I can't solve the equation. Next, I'll analyze Function #1 and #2 again to find a relationship between a and b. I'll try different values of x to obtain more information about a. Then, I'll input my revised values into the <Code secured door> to test my assumption.<New Row>You assign the value 0.5*pi to x of the function #1, and then the function outputs 13.729577951308233. (Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].)<New Row>Error, your input ""*math.pi/2"" is not valid. Please only input decimals, integers, and random decimal * pi<New Row>You assign the value 2 to x of the function #1, and then the function outputs 11.774379414605454. (Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].)<New Row>You assign the value 0.25*pi to x of the function #2, and then the function outputs 11.459155902616464. (Function #2 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b'].)<New Row>You assign the value pi to x of the function #1, and then the function outputs 2.864788975654117. (Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].)","
Based on the observations, I assume Function #1 has terms 'a*sin(x)' and 'b/x', and Function #2 has a single term 'b*sin(x)'. My plan is to assign x=1 to both functions and analyze the outputs to deduce the values of 'a' and 'b'. I will then input thevalues of 'a' and 'b' in alphabetical order into the <Code secured door> to test my assumption. If the attempt fails, I will refine my hypothesis based on the door's feedback and repeat the process.<New Row>
My assumption remains valid. I deduce that b = 4 based on the output of Function #2. For Function #1, with x = 1, the output 4.841470984807897 = a*sin(1) + b/x = a*sin(1) + 4. Since sin(1) = 0.841470984807897, a = 4.841470984807897 / 0.841470984807897 ≈ 5.753. Next, I will input a = 5 and b = 4 into the <Code secured door> in alphabetical order to test my assumption.<New Row>nj

My assumption is not valid. Based on recent observations, I revise my assumption: b = 4, but a is unknown. From Function #1, I know a*sin(1) + b = 4.841470984807897, but without knowing a, I can't solve the equation. Next, I'll analyze Function #1 and #2 again to find a relationship between a and b. I'll try different values of x to obtain more information about a. Then, I'll input my revised values into the <Code secured door> to test my assumption.",,0<step>5<step>8,

Based on the hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" and the observation of the two oil paintings in the Oil Painting Gallery, I propose the following assumption: The password is related to the dominant colors of the paintings. The dominant color of <Sapphire Night Oil Paint> is blue, and the dominant color of <Emerald Tide Oil Paint> is green.

I plan to input ""2-5-1"" into the <Code Secured Door>, assuming 1 for blue, 2 for green, and the third digit as a placeholder.

Based on the new hint ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth"" and the changed password, I revise my assumption: The password is related to the colors mentioned in the hints. Since the first digit was correct in previous attempts, I propose that yellow is represented by 1.

Based on the hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" and the observation that there are two blue paintings, I assume that the password is related to the blue paintings. My initial assumption is that the password is the sequence of numbers corresponding to the blue paintings in the order they appear in the gallery. 

My planned action is to input the password ""234"" into the <Code Secured Door>, as <Sapphire Night Oil Paint> is the 2nd painting and <Coastal Serenity Oil Paint> is the 4th painting. I will not investigate other galleries yet, as the hint suggests that the answer lies within the Oil Painting Gallery.<New Row>ing.In this puzzle, set in an art gallery, Kevin must uncover the password for the <Code Secured Door> by discovering the relationships between the password and the paintings. In the latest attempt, the password was changed, and a new hint says ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth."" My revised assumption is that the password is related to the yellow paintings. My planned action is to input the password ""136"" into the <Code Secured Door>, as <Lemon Grove Oil Paint> is the 1st painting and <Flower Oil Paint> is the 3rd painting, then <Flower Oil Paint> is the 3rd painting, and finally try opening it.<New Row>
My current assumption is that the password is related to the yellow paintings. However, my previous attempt with the password ""136"" was incorrect. Since the first digit of the previous correct attempt was ""2"", I'll try to relate it to the yellow paintings. My revised assumption is that the password is related to the order or position of the yellow paintings. My planned action is to input the password ""213"" into the <Code Secured Door>, as <Lemon Grove Oil Paint> is the 2nd painting and <Flower Oil Paint> is the 1st painting.<New Row>reasonable and concise.

My current assumption is no longer valid as the password changed, and now it says ""Focus on black it hides the truth."" My revised assumption is that the password is related to the black paintings, but there are no black paintings. I will re-examine the paintings and find a new connection. My planned action is to check each painting again, looking for any black elements or hints that could lead me to the correct password.<New Row>plx. At this point, I will re-examine the paintings, focusing on any black elements or hints. My current assumption is that the password is related to black, but there are no black paintings. I will review each painting again, searching for black details or connections to uncover the password. Next, I will input my new assumption into the Code Secured Door to test its validity.<New Row>etrothetic question.<New Row>.Columns:

**Current Assumption**
-Blue and yellow are important because they are mentioned in the hints.
-I will look at the paintings again.
-I will think about the last digit.

**Plan**
-Check how many paintings have blue or yellow.
-Try to find the relationship between code and the paintings.
-Update the password based on the relationship found.

-Update the password based on the relationship found.

but the hint is now ""Focus on black it hides the truth."" so I will revise my assumption to focus on black paintings and redirection of yellow and blue.
**New Assumption**
-No black paintings because it does not exist.
-I will think about the absence of black.

**New Plan**

My assumption is that the password is related to the paintings with blue in them, as hinted by the note ""Focus on blue it hides the truth."" I propose that the password is the number of paintings with blue in each gallery. Based on the <Midnight Dance Oil Paint>, I'll input ""1"" as the first digit. Next, I'll investigate the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery to find paintings with blue, counting them to complete the password. If no blue paintings are found in either gallery, I'll explore further to identify other connections between blue and the password.<New Row>rencent observation is that password is changed indicating that assumption of blue is not accurate. This means the hint was a red herring. The new hint is ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth."" My new assumption is that the password is related to the paintings with yellow in them.

Next, I'll investigate the Oil Painting Gallery, Watercolour Gallery, and Acrylic Painting Gallery to find paintings with yellow, counting them to complete the password.<New Row>antity is  determined: 
My assumption remains valid. The password is related to the paintings with yellow in them. In Oil Painting Gallery, I found no paintings with yellow. In Watercolour Gallery, I also found no paintings with yellow. In Acrylic Painting Gallery, I found no paintings with yellow. My next step is to carefully re-examine every painting in each gallery to ensure I haven't missed any paintings with yellow. Then, I'll use the count to form the password and input it into the Code Secured Door.<New Row>per assumption: 
My assumption is not valid. The note said ""Focus on blue"" but previously I focused on yellow. Now that I re-examine every painting, I found that all paintings have blue in them.

Based on the hint ""Focus on blue, it hides the truth,"" I assume the password relates to the blue-dominated paintings in the Oil Painting Gallery. Initially, I'll input ""123"" as the password, considering the three blue paintings: Sapphire Night, Ocean, and Midnight Dance. If it's incorrect, I'll investigate the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery to see if they contain any blue-themed paintings or clues. The password might be hidden in a pattern or code within the blue artworks.<New Row>
My previous assumption no longer holds, as the password has changed and the hint now focuses on yellow. I revise my assumption to consider yellow-dominated paintings in all galleries. My plan is to explore the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery to find yellow-themed paintings or clues. I'll then input a new password based on the relationships I discover. With the changed hint, I'll restart my investigation, focusing on yellow to uncover the new password.<New Row>ote:Only one paragraph is allowed. 
My current assumption remains that the password is related to yellow-dominated paintings. I've discovered two yellow-themed paintings: <Summer Fields Watercolor Paint> and <Morning Glory Acrylic Paint>.

My current assumption is that the reaction follows a pattern of substitution, where the second reactant replaces an element in the first reactant. Based on XY+Z = XZ + Y, I propose that the reaction replaces the second element in XY with Z, resulting in XZ and releasing Y.

To test this assumption, I will use materials <A> and <B> in the reactor. If my assumption is correct, I expect the reaction AB + C (if I have C available) to produce AC + B.<New Row>

Here's my revised assumption and plan:

Revised Assumption: The password is related to the dominant colors of the paintings, with a priority on the color mentioned in the hint.

New Plan: With the new hint ""Focus on black it hides the truth"", I'll prioritize black-dominant paintings. I notice that one painting has black as the dominant color: <Midnight Dance Oil Paint>. My next attempt will be a combination of this painting's corresponding number. I'll input ""1"" as the password, where 1 corresponds to <Midnight Dance Oil Paint>.<New Row>Kevin tried the following action: Input code to the Code Secured Door and try opening it, Kevin's decision is 1, but the password was incorrect.The <Code Secured Door> requires 3 digit password, but your input have 1 digits, which is not correct.<New Row>You can still try 2 times before the password change!<New Row>Kevin tried the following action: Input code to the Code Secured Door and try opening it, Kevin's decision is 123, but the password was incorrect.Kevin's first digit 1 is incorrect.

Kevin's second digit 2 is incorrect. Kevin's third digit 3 is incorrect. <New Row>You tried too many times, the password is now changed. The lines on the screen says: ""Focus on green it hides the truth.""","

My assumption is that the password is related to the dominant colors of the paintings. The note ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" suggests that blue is important. I notice that two paintings have dominant blue colors: <Midnight Dance Oil Paint> and <River Reflections Watercolor Paint>. I plan to input a password combining the numbers corresponding to these paintings. My initial attempt will be ""246"" (2 for Midnight Dance, 4 for River Reflections, and 6 as a placeholder). If unsuccessful, I'll investigate other galleries to find more blue-dominant paintings or explore other color relationships.<New Row>

My current assumption is that the password is related to the dominant colors of the paintings. However, with the new hint ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth"", I revise my assumption to prioritize yellow-dominant paintings. I notice that two paintings have yellow as the dominant color: <Lemon Grove Oil Paint> and <Summer Fields Watercolor Paint>. My next attempt will be a combination of these paintings' corresponding numbers. I'll input ""35"" as the password, where 3 corresponds to <Lemon Grove Oil Paint> and 5 corresponds to <Summer Fields Watercolor Paint>.<New Row> mutlu

My assumption: Focus on black and darker shades in the paintings to find numerical connections.

Next steps: I'll analyze <Winter Chill Acrylic Paint> and <Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint>, focusing on black and darker shades. I'll search for numbers, shapes, or patterns that could relate to the password.

The lines on the screen says: ""Focus on green it hides the truth.""","
Assumption: The password is related to the colors blue and green, as hinted by ""Focus on blue it hides the truth."" I think the password is a combination of the number of blue paintings, green paintings, and a numerical value associated with one of the blue paintings.

Initial plan: I will input ""324"" as the password, considering 3 blue oil paintings, 2 blue watercolor paintings, and 4 being a value associated with one of the blue paintings (e.g., the number of trees in <Bluebell Woods Acrylic Paint>). I will investigate other galleries if my attempt is unsuccessful.<New Row>kám

My assumption remains: The password is related to colors, now hinted by ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth."" I think the password is a combination of the number of yellow paintings, green paintings, and a numerical value associated with one of the yellow paintings.

Initial plan: I will investigate yellow paintings. There's only one yellow painting, <Morning Glory Acrylic Paint>. I'll examine it closely to find a numerical value associated with it. Then, I'll input a new password, considering the number of yellow paintings, green paintings, and the numerical value.<New Row> as much as you can.

My assumption remains: The password is related to colors, specifically focusing on yellow, green, and a numerical value associated with the yellow painting.

Next plan: Since the second digit is correct (2), I'll keep it as it is. For the first digit, I'll consider the number of yellow paintings (1). For the third digit, I'll examine the <Morning Glory Acrylic Paint> to find a numerical value; I found the painting's size: 12 inches x 12 inches. My new input will be 122.<New Row>
My assumption remains: The password is related to colors, specifically focusing on yellow and numerical values associated with the yellow painting.

Next plan: Since the second digit 2 was correct previously, I'll focus on the other two digits. For the first digit, I'll consider the shade of yellow in the <Morning Glory Acrylic Paint> (light or dark). For the third digit, I'll examine the painting's size: 12 inches x 12 inches. My new input will be 212. If incorrect, I'll reassess the yellow painting's details.<New Row>
My assumption needs revision. The new hint ""Focus on black it hides the truth"" suggests the password is related to black, not yellow or colors. I'll reassess the paintings, focusing on black or darker shades. My next plan is to examine the paintings with darker colors, such as <Winter Chill Acrylic Paint> or <Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint>, to find numerical connections. I'll input a new code based on my findings.<New Row>enha

My assumption: Focus on black and darker shades in the paintings to find numerical connections. My next plan is to examine <Winter Chill Acrylic Paint> and <Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint>, looking for numerical patterns. 

Next steps: I'll carefully analyze these paintings, focusing on black and darker shades. I'll search for numbers, shapes, or patterns that could relate to the password. I'll input a new code based on my findings, hoping to unlock the door.<New Row>

Based on the hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth,"" I assume the password relates to the blue-themed paintings. My initial assumption is that the password consists of the numbers corresponding to the order of the blue paintings in the room.

Given the password change and new hint (""Focus on green it hides the truth""), my assumption remains valid: the password relates to the counts of different painting types themed in a specific color mentioned in the hint. With this new hint, I need to re-count the green-themed paintings. My next plan is to review the paintings and count the green-themed oil, acrylic, and watercolor paintings to refine my password assumption. Then, I will input the new password into the <Code Secured Door> to test my hypothesis.","
My initial assumption is that the password relates to the number of blue-dominant paintings in each art style. There are 3 oil paintings, 3 acrylic paintings, and 3 watercolor paintings with a blue theme. Based on this observation, my password assumption is ""3-3-3"".

Next, I plan to input ""3-3-3"" into the <Code Secured Door> to test my assumption. If it's incorrect, I'll revisit the paintings to refine my assumption. I've checked all the paintings in this corridor, so I won't need to investigate other galleries initially.<New Row> shall update his assumption and plan based on the new hint and previous observations.

My current assumption is that password relates to yellow-dominant paintings. There are 2 acrylic paintings and 1 watercolor painting with a yellow theme. Based on this observation, my password assumption is ""2-1-0"".

Next, I plan to input ""2-1-0"" into the <Code Secured Door> to test my assumption. If it's incorrect, I'll revisit the paintings to refine my assumption.<New Row> 
My current assumption is that password relates to blue-dominant paintings. There are 6 oil paintings, 2 acrylic paintings, and 3 watercolor paintings with a blue theme. Since the hint says ""Focus on black it hides the truth"", I assume that black is connected to blue. Based on this observation, my password assumption is ""6-2-3"". Next, I plan to input ""6-2-3"" into the <Code Secured Door> to test my assumption.<New Row>  



My current assumption is that password relates to the counts of different painting types themed in a specific color mentioned in the hint. Since the hint says ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"", I assume that blue is the target color. Based on this observation, my password assumption is that it is related to the counts of blue-themed oil, acrylic, and watercolor paintings. However, my previous guess ""6-2-3"" was incorrect. My next plan is to review the paintings and re-count the blue-themed paintings to refine my password assumption.<New Row>

My assumption is that the password is related to the colors of the paintings. The note ""Focus on blue"" suggests that blue is crucial. The painting <Midnight Dance Oil Paint> has a blue night sky, which might be relevant. I propose that the password consists of digits corresponding to the order of colors in the painting. For example, if blue is the dominant color, followed by the moon's white, and then the dark background, the password could be 123. I will input 123 into the <Code Secured Door> and observe the result. If incorrect, I will investigate the other galleries.<New Row>

My assumption remains that the password is related to the colors of the paintings. With the new hint ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth"", I propose that the password consists of digits corresponding to the order of colors in a painting from the Watercolour Gallery, where yellow is prominent.

My next step will be to input the corresponding digits into the <Code Secured Door> to test the password.<New Row>

My assumption remains that the password is related to the colors of the paintings. Since I've entered the Watercolour Gallery and found a painting with green, I propose that the password consists of digits corresponding to the color order in a painting with yellow.

My current assumption is that the password is related to the paintings' colors. Initially, I thought the password was 189, but it was incorrect. Now, I assume the first digit is 1, and the other two digits are related to the blue colors in the paintings. Since the blue paintings are <Midnight Dance Oil Paint> and <Winter Chill Acrylic Paint>, I'll try the code 146 (1 for the first digit, 4 for the fourth letter in ""blue"", and 6 for the sixth letter in ""winter"").

Based on the note ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" and the paintings, I assume the password is related to the colors of the paintings.

Current Assumption: 
The password relates to the colors of the paintings. The hint ""Focus on blue it hides the truth"" might indicate that the correct password is hidden in the blue-themed painting, <Sapphire Night Oil Paint>.

Plan for Further Verification: 
I'll input ""258"" as the password, assuming the numbers correspond to the RGB color code of blue (R=2, G=5, B=8). If incorrect, I'll explore the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery to find more blue-themed paintings or other clues that might relate to the password.<New Row>instance folder.
Current Assumption: 
The password relates to the colors of the paintings. The new hint ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth"" indicates that the correct password is hidden in a yellow-themed painting.

You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 3 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: ""x^2"" (square of x),'x','|x|' (absolute value of x) and '1/x'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c, d}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Funciton #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 3 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b', 'c'].
Function #2 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['d', 'b'].
Function #3 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b'].

(Function #1 have 3 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b', 'c'].)You just updated your plan and your assumption following is your new assumption and plan: eglible.

My current assumption is that Function #1 is a polynomial function with 3 terms, Function #2 may involve the absolute value, and Function #3 is the reciprocal function. 

I plan to solve Function #3 first since it has only one term. With output 7.0, I deduce that b must be 7. Next, I'll focus on Function #1. With outputs 31 and 48, I'll try to find the relationship between these outputs and the parameters a, b, and c. Then, I'll move to Function #2 to determine d. Once I'm confident, I'll input the values into the <Code secured door> to test my result.<New Row>You assign the value 4 to x of the function #1, and then the function outputs 69.

My current assumption is that Function #1 is a polynomial function with 3 terms, Function #2 may involve the absolute value, and Function #3 may involve the reciprocal. 

I plan to assign a value of 1 to x and see the output of each function to get a better understanding of the terms and their coefficients. I'll then try to deduce the parameters from the output, focusing on Function #3 first since it has only one term. If needed, I'll try different values of x to further verify my assumption.

Assumption: The password is related to the dominant colors of the paintings. Since the hint says ""Focus on blue,"" I assume the password is a combination of the numbers of blue paintings. 

Plan: I will count the number of blue paintings and input the result as the password. Currently, I've found three blue paintings: <Coastal Serenity Oil Paint>, <Midnight Dance Oil Paint>, and <Ocean Oil Paint>. My initial password will be ""3-1-1"" (three blue paintings, one yellow, and one green). If it doesn't work, I'll investigate the Watercolour and Acrylic Painting Galleries to see if there are any other blue paintings.<New Row> titel your answer with Current Assumption and Plan

You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 2 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: ""x^2"" (square of x) and '1/x'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Funciton #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve:
