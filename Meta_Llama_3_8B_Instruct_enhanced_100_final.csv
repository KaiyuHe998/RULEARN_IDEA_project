Based on the observations, my hypothesis is that the password is related to the blue colors in the paintings. I will input the code ""123"" into the <Code Secured Door> to test my hypothesis. If it doesn't work, I will investigate the other galleries to see if there are any other blue paintings. If I still can't find the correct password, I will try brute force. My initial hypothesis is that the password is a combination of the blue colors in the paintings, such as the blue night sky, blue winter scene, and blue it hides the truth.<New Row>. 

Based on the recent observation, my hypothesis remains that the password is related to the blue colors in the paintings. Since the second digit ""1"" is correct, I will focus on the blue colors in the paintings. I will try to find a connection between the blue night sky and the blue winter scene. My next step is to input the code ""01?"" into the <Code Secured Door> to test my hypothesis. If it doesn't work, I will try to find another connection between the paintings.

Here is my answer:
My hypothesis is that the password is related to the colors of the paintings. Specifically, I think the password is the number of blue colors in each painting. For example, the <Emerald Tide Oil Paint> has no blue, so the password digit for this painting is 0. The <Sapphire Night Oil Paint> has a blue night sky, so the password digit for this painting is 1. The <Bluebell Woods Acrylic Paint> has blue woods, so the password digit for this painting is 1. The <Arctic Silence Watercolor Paint> has blue arctic, so the password digit for this painting is 1. The <River Reflections Watercolor Paint> has a blue river, so the password digit for this painting is 1. The <Morning Glory Acrylic Paint> has no blue, so the password digit for this painting is 0. I plan to input the password 111 into the <Code Secured Door>. If this doesn't work, I will investigate the other galleries to see if there are any other clues.<New Row>
My hypothesis is that the password is related to the colors of the paintings. Specifically, I think the password is the number of blue colors in each painting. However, the recent observation suggests that the password has changed, and the hint now says ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth."" I plan to re-examine the paintings and look for any yellow colors. If I find any, I will update my hypothesis and try again. My next action will be to check the <Morning Glory Acrylic Paint> again, as it is the only painting with yellow. 1th action: Input code to the Code Secured Door and try opening it.<New Row>

````
**Hypothesis:** The password is a combination of the number of blue colors in each painting. For example, the <Sapphire Night Oil Paint> has a blue night sky, so the digit for this painting is 1. Similarly, the <Coastal Serenity Oil Paint> has a blue coast, so the digit for this painting is 1. The <Winter Chill Acrylic Paint> has a blue winter scene, so the digit for this painting is 1. And so on.

**Plan:** Since the first digit 1 is incorrect, I will re-evaluate my hypothesis. I will check the paintings again to see if I missed any blue colors. I will also try to find other paintings that have blue colors and adjust the password accordingly. If I exceed the attempt limit, I will re-evaluate my hypothesis and try again. I will also investigate any galleries I haven't checked yet to see if they provide any additional clues.````

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 2 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: ""x^2"" (square of x) and '-x' negative x. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].
Function #2 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b'].
<New Row>Kevin checked <Code secured door>, and found the result: This <Code secured door> is the only exit from this room. To unlock it and leave, you must enter the correct code. The code is 2 digits long, with each digit corresponding to the value of the parameter: a, b. You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.You just updated your plan and your hypothesis following is your new hypothesis and plan: g

Currently there are following items in this room: <Computer>,<Code secured door><New Row>Kevin checked <Computer>, and found the result: This <Computer> consists of 3 different univariate functions, each with one variable, x. Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: '1/x','|x|' (absolute value of x) and 'x'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].
Function #2 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b', 'c'].
Function #3 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'c'].
<New Row>Kevin checked <Code secured door>, and found the result: This <Code secured door> is the only exit from this room. To unlock it and leave, you must enter the correct code. The code is 3 digits long, with each digit corresponding to the value of the parameter: a, b, c. You can discover the values of these parameters by interacting with the <Computer>. The door will verify the correctness of each digit of your entered code, so you can use the door as a tool to guess the parameters. However, if you fail 4 times, the parameter values will change.<New Row>You assign the value pi to x of the function #1, and then the function outputs 0.6366197723675814.

All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b, c}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a', 'b'].

My hypothesis is still valid. The blue paintings hide the truth, so I will focus on the blue paintings. Since the first digit 0 is incorrect, I will try to find a blue painting with a different dominant color. I will check the <Bluebell Woods Acrylic Paint> again and see if I can find any other clues. My next action is 1th action: Check <Bluebell Woods Acrylic Paint> again.

I will input the password ""123"" into the <Code Secured Door>. If it doesn't work, I will try to find more blue paintings in the gallery. I will also check the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery to see if there are any blue paintings there. If I still can't find the password, I will try brute force. My initial hypothesis is that the password is related to the blue colors in the paintings.<New Row>ey. Here is my answer:
My current hypothesis is that the password is related to the blue colors in the paintings. Since the first three digits I inputted were incorrect, I will try to find more blue paintings in the gallery. I will check the Watercolour Gallery and Acrylic Painting Gallery to see if there are any blue paintings there. If I still can't find the password, I will try brute force. My next action will be to pass through the Watercolour Gallery Entrance and reaches the Watercolour Gallery. I will check the paintings in the Watercolour Gallery to see if there are any blue paintings.<New Row>
My current hypothesis is that the password is related to the blue colors in the paintings. However, the note on the ground says ""Focus on yellow it hides the truth."" This suggests that the password is actually related to the yellow colors in the paintings. My next action will be to check the yellow paintings in the Oil Painting Gallery and the Acrylic Painting Gallery to see if there are any yellow paintings there. If I still can't find the password, I will try brute force. My next action will be to pass through the Oil Painting Gallery Entrance and reaches the Oil Painting Gallery. I will check the paintings in the Oil Painting Gallery to see if there are any yellow paintings. 1th action: Input code to the Code Secured Door and try opening it.

Final Answer: The final answer is<New Row>111 is  the correct input for <Code Secured Door>.<New Row>You can still try 2 times before the password change!","In my hypothesis, I believe that the password is related to the colors of the paintings. Specifically, I think the password is the number of colors present in each painting. For example, the <Flower Oil Paint> has only one color (yellow), so the corresponding digit is 1. Similarly, the <River Reflections Watercolor Paint> has two colors (blue and water), so the corresponding digit is 2. I plan to input the password 1-1-1 for the first attempt, and then adjust based on the result.<New Row>
Here is my revised hypothesis and plan:
My hypothesis is that the password is related to the colors of the paintings, but not the number of colors. Instead, I think the password is the number of times each color appears in the painting. For example, the <Flower Oil Paint> has only yellow, so the corresponding digit is 1. The <River Reflections Watercolor Paint> has blue, so the corresponding digit is 1. I plan to input the password 1-1-1 for the next attempt. If it's still incorrect, I'll adjust my hypothesis and plan accordingly.<New Row>

Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: '-x' negative x and '1/x'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].
Function #2 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b'].

Based on the observations, my hypothesis is that the password is related to the dominant color of each painting. The password consists of three digits, which could represent the number of times each color appears in the painting. For example, the password for the <Code Secured Door> could be 3-2-1, representing the number of times blue appears in the paintings. I plan to input the password 3-2-1 into the <Code Secured Door> and try opening it.

You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve:

My hypothesis is that the password is related to the colors of the paintings, but not just blue. I think the password is the number of colors in each painting that are not green. For example, the Ocean Oil Paint has a blue ocean, but also a blue sky, so the first digit of the password is 2. The Coastal Serenity Oil Paint has a blue coast, but also a blue sky, so the second digit is 2. The other paintings do not have colors other than green, so their corresponding digits are 0. Therefore, the password is 202. I will input this password into the Code Secured Door and try to open it. 
I will try again with the same password, hoping to get the third digit correct. If I fail again, I will revise my hypothesis to consider other colors.

The Coastal Serenity Oil Paint has a blue coast, but also a blue sky, so the second digit is 2. The other paintings do not have colors other than green, so their corresponding digits are 0. Therefore, the password is 202. I will input this password into the Code Secured Door and try to open it. 
I will try again with the same password, hoping to get the third digit correct. If I fail again, I will revise my hypothesis to consider other colors. 
Final Answer: The final answer is 202. I hope it is correct. 202. I will input this password into the Code Secured Door and try to open it. I will try again with the same password, hoping to get the third digit correct. If I fail again, I will revise my hypothesis to consider other colors. 202.

Based on the observations, my hypothesis is that the password is related to the colors of the paintings. Specifically, I think the password is the number of blue colors in each painting. For example, <Ocean Oil Paint> has a blue ocean, so it would contribute 1 to the password. Similarly, <Bluebell Woods Acrylic Paint> has blue woods, so it would contribute 1 to the password as well. I will input the password 101 into the <Code Secured Door> and see if it opens. If it doesn't, I will try to find other galleries to investigate. My next action is 1th action: Input code to the Code Secured Door and try opening it.<New Row>
Based on the observations, my hypothesis is still that the password is related to the colors of the paintings. However, I realize that my previous attempt was incorrect. I will try to input a 3-digit password this time. Since <Ocean Oil Paint>, <Bluebell Woods Acrylic Paint>, and <Ocean Depths Watercolor Paint> all have blue colors, I will input 3 as the first digit. Next, I will examine the other paintings to determine the second and third digits. My next action is 1th action: Input code to the Code Secured Door and try opening it.<New Row>

```python
Here is my answer:

Based on the observations, I hypothesize that the password for the <Code Secured Door> is related to the colors present in the paintings. Specifically, I think the password is a combination of the first letter of the colors mentioned in the paintings. For example, the first letter of the color ""blue"" in <Sapphire Night Oil Paint> and <Coastal Serenity Oil Paint> is ""B"". Similarly, the first letter of the color ""yellow"" in <Flower Oil Paint> and <Lemon Grove Oil Paint> is ""Y"". I plan to input the password ""BYB"" into the <Code Secured Door> and try opening it. If it doesn't work, I will investigate the remaining galleries to gather more information. My next action is 1th action: Input code to the Code Secured Door and try opening it.```

Each function is composed of one or more of the following monomials: '|x|' (absolute value of x) and 'sin(x)'. All functions share a set of constant parameters, which are integers range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and are listed here: {a, b}, Each parameter is unique and can appear multiple times in different function either a coefficient or an additive constant(eg, Function #x could have term b*x, and Function #y could have a constant term b*x + b, and Function #z could have a term b*sin(x)). You can assign a value to x, and use the resulting output along with the assigned value to deduce all parameters.And the following are the information of all the functions you need to solve: 
Function #1 have 1 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['a'].
Function #2 have 2 terms and the following parameters(Could be constant or coefficients): ['b', 'b'].

My hypothesis remains valid. The blue paintings hide the truth. Since the first digit 0 is incorrect, I will focus on the blue paintings again. I will check the blue paintings in the Watercolour Gallery to see if there are any clues. My plan is to input the code 011 again, but this time, pay attention to the blue paintings. If it fails, I will try brute force. I will choose action 1th action: Input code to the Code Secured Door and try opening it. I will try to find the dominant color of the blue paintings to determine the correct code.
