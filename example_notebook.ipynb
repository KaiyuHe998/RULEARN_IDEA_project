You need to research and generate the corresponding chemical material required in the <Task Monitor> In this puzzle, you need to explore the patterns of reaction by conducting continuous experiments(The law is simple and can be described in one sentense). Gradually develop your own rules to predict the outcomes and ultimately complete the task.You know from an incomplete list of reaction equations that: XY+Z = XZY. X, Y, and Z are placeholders representing different reactants or products, not specific substances.\n",
